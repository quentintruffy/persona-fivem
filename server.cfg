# This file is a minimal version of the default config file.
# This is NOT supposed to be enough for most servers.
# Please read the fivem documentation:
#   https://aka.cfx.re/server-commands
#   https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server/

## You SHOULD edit the following:
sv_hostname "{{serverName}} built with {{recipeName}}!"
sets sv_projectName "[{{recipeName}}] {{serverName}}"
sets sv_projectDesc "{{recipeDescription}}"
sets tags "default, deployer"
sets locale "root-AQ"

## You CAN edit the following:
sv_enforceGameBuild 3407 #mp2024_02	Agents of Sabotage
sv_licenseKey "{{svLicense}}"
sv_maxclients {{maxClients}}
{{serverEndpoints}}
set steam_webApiKey "none"
set resources_useSystemChat true

## These resources will start by default.
